		Summary:
			'CanvasRoom is a real-time collaboration platform that combines coding, drawing, and messaging in one seamless experience. It allows users to work collaboratively in real time, making it ideal for developers, designers, and teams needing dynamic interaction tools.',
		'Lesson Learned':
			'Through this project, I gained extensive experience in full-stack development with technologies like React, Node.js, and Socket.IO. I learned about implementing real-time communication, managing shared state across users, and securing multi-user systems with authentication. Additionally, working with MongoDB reinforced my knowledge of database persistence.',
		'Tech Stack': 'React, Node.js, Socket.IO, MongoDB',
		'How to Run': 'Visit the website: https://canvasroom.onrender.com/. The application may take a bit to load. It allows you to log in as two users for testing purposes.',
		'Sample Login Details':
			'No sample login details are needed; users can create an account or join a room with secure access.',
		'Project Purpose and Goal':
			'The aim of CanvasRoom was to create a versatile collaboration platform where users can code, draw, and communicate in real-time. The primary goal was to enhance productivity and creativity by integrating multi-user functionalities in a unified interface.',
		'Web Stack and Explanation':
			'React was used for the frontend due to its component-based architecture and ease of state management. Node.js and Socket.IO handled the backend, enabling real-time communication. MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility in storing user data, code snippets, and drawings, ensuring data persistence.',
		'Problems and Thought Process':
			'One of the challenges was ensuring synchronization across multiple users, especially for collaborative coding and drawing. Implementing Socket.IO effectively allowed for real-time updates with minimal latency. Another challenge was creating a secure authentication system, which was resolved by integrating encrypted tokens for room access. Future improvements include enhanced role management, mobile responsiveness, and adding more collaboration tools.',
